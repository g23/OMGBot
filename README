This is a simple Scala Bot that plays many games of LetterBlox on OMGPOP.

To use:

Compile with scala or fsc: fsc Bot.scala

Then run: scala Bot

It'll take a few moments to prepocess the wordlist then it'll ask for the shuffled list. Then you have 5 seconds to move your mouse over the game area. The bot will then click and start typing all the words.

It's probably inefficient since it uses BigIntegers when Longs would probably suffice. That doesn't really matter though as it's too fast already.
